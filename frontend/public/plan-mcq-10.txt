A. Arrow Key Behavior & Canvas Navigation

1. How should new panning shortcuts coexist with existing arrow key behavior that moves tables by 10px (via moveTables in Hotkey.elm)?
A. Replace table movement with canvas panning entirely
B. Use Shift+Arrow for canvas panning, keep Arrow keys for table movement
C. Use context-aware behavior (pan when nothing selected, move when table selected)
D. Use Alt+Arrow for table movement, Arrow keys for panning
E. Let users configure the behavior in settings
➡️ Needs input — The existing moveTables function uses {dx: ±10, dy: ±10} for grid-aligned movement. Need to decide if this behavior should be preserved or modified.

B. Zoom Implementation Details

2. What zoom increment should keyboard shortcuts use? Current Conf.elm defines zoom: { min: 0.001, max: 5, speed: 0.001 }
A. Use existing speed value (0.001) from Conf.canvas.zoom.speed
B. 10% of current zoom level (zoom * 0.1)
C. Fixed 0.1 increment regardless of current zoom
D. Match the scroll wheel zoom behavior
E. Logarithmic scaling based on current zoom level
➡️ Assumed: B (10% increments) — Provides consistent feel at all zoom levels. At zoom=1, increment is 0.1; at zoom=2, increment is 0.2.

C. Canvas Panning Implementation

3. How many pixels should each Shift+Arrow key press pan the canvas? Current table movement uses 10px grid.
A. 10px (match existing Conf.canvas.grid value)
B. 50px (noticeable but controlled movement)
C. 100px (faster navigation for large schemas)
D. Percentage of viewport (10% of visible area)
E. Configurable via Conf.elm
➡️ Needs input — Panning needs to feel different from table movement. Consider that users navigate schemas with 100+ tables.

D. Tool Switching Implementation

4. What keyboard shortcuts should be used for tool switching given existing hotkeys in Conf.elm?
A. Number keys (1 for select, 2 for drag) - simple but may conflict
B. 'v' for select, 'h' for hand/drag (matches Figma)
C. Space bar to toggle between tools (temporary drag while held)
D. 'd' for drag - but note 'd' is currently unused in hotkeys
E. Tab to cycle through tools
➡️ Assumed: B — 'v' is industry standard. 'h' for hand tool avoids conflict with existing 'h' (hide) by using a modifier.

E. New Hotkey Entries in Conf.elm

5. What format should new hotkeys follow in the Conf.hotkeys Dict? Current format: ( "action-name", [ { hotkey | key = "x", ctrl = True } ] )
A. Follow existing naming: "zoom-in", "zoom-out", "pan-up", etc.
B. Use grouped naming: "canvas-zoom-in", "canvas-pan-up", etc.
C. Use shorthand: "z+", "z-", "p↑", etc.
D. Match DOM event key names exactly
E. Use numeric codes instead of names
➡️ Assumed: A — Matches existing patterns like "move-up", "reset-zoom", "fit-to-screen" in Conf.elm.

F. Integration with Existing Zoom (reset-zoom, fit-to-screen)

6. How should new zoom shortcuts interact with existing Ctrl+0 (reset-zoom) and Ctrl+Alt+0 (fit-to-screen)?
A. Replace them with simpler = and - shortcuts
B. Keep existing shortcuts, add = and - as alternatives
C. Remove reset-zoom, keep only fit-to-screen
D. Consolidate all zoom controls under a single modifier
E. Make = and - primary, move Ctrl+0 to secondary
➡️ Assumed: B — Preserves backward compatibility. Power users keep muscle memory while new users discover simpler shortcuts.

G. Help Modal Updates (HelpMsg in Hotkey.elm)

7. The Help modal is triggered by "?" hotkey. How should new shortcuts be documented?
A. Add new "Navigation" section in Help modal
B. Append to existing keyboard shortcuts list
C. Create separate "Canvas Controls" help tab
D. Show tooltips on hover instead of help modal
E. Auto-generate documentation from Conf.hotkeys Dict
➡️ Needs input — Help modal structure affects discoverability. Consider whether to group by feature or by key type.

H. Testing Strategy for Hotkey Handlers

8. What testing approach for the new handlers in Hotkey.elm?
A. Manual browser testing only
B. Elm unit tests for handleHotkey cases + browser testing
C. Property-based tests with elm-test
D. Integration tests with elm-program-test
E. E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
➡️ Assumed: B — Follows existing pattern. handleHotkey is a pure function that returns (Model, Extra Msg), testable with elm-test.

I. Message Types for New Actions

9. What Msg types are needed? Current pattern uses specific messages like Zoom, FitToScreen, TableMove.
A. Reuse existing Zoom msg with delta parameter
B. Add new ZoomIn, ZoomOut, PanCanvas Delta messages
C. Single CanvasAction msg with action type parameter
D. Extend TableMove to handle canvas panning
E. Use port commands directly without Elm messages
➡️ Needs input — Architecture decision affects code organization. Consider whether canvas panning is conceptually similar to table movement.

J. Implementation Priority

10. In what order should features be implemented given the existing codebase structure?
A. All features in single PR
B. Phase 1: Zoom (=/-/0), Phase 2: Pan (Shift+Arrows), Phase 3: Tools & Help
C. Start with Help modal updates, then add shortcuts incrementally
D. Implement panning first as it's most requested
E. Random order based on complexity
➡️ Assumed: B — Zoom builds on existing performZoom infrastructure. Pan requires new Delta handling. Tools need UI changes.
